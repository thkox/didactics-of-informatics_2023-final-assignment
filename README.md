## Assignments

### Assignment A: Learning Object (LO)

**Description**: For this task, I developed a Learning Object (LO) to support the teaching of a specific topic in Informatics. The LO was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript and provides users with interactive features for exploration and experimentation. The topic selected is "Scope of Constants and Variables in Modular Programming."

- **Implementation**: The LO is designed to help students understand how variables and constants behave in different scopes within modular programming. Users can interact with the web-based application to explore different scenarios.
- **Files**: All related files, including HTML, CSS, and Javascript, are located in the `web-app/` folder.

### Assignment B: Educational Scenario

**Description**: In this task, I developed an educational scenario that utilizes the LO created in Assignment A. The scenario is designed to teach the concept of "Scope of Constants and Variables in Modular Programming" within one or more teaching hours.

- **Structure**: The scenario follows the format and guidelines discussed in the course, making full use of the LO developed in Assignment A.
- **Files**: The scenario is documented in `Project-documentation.docx`, located in the `docs/` folder.
